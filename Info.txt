ShePolicy Outline Navigator — Round 1A Proposal

Problem Statement
Women at large enterprises wade through 150‑page HR PDFs (maternity, harassment, equal‑pay policies). Manual ctrl‑F misses clause changes; legal jargon hides actionable rights; HR desks answer slowly.

🔴 Existing Pain

Hours lost scanning dense policy handbooks
No tooling to diff yearly handbook versions
Generic PDF outliners ignore women‑centric sections
Disclosure risk: employees must open tickets just to ask about leave
✅ Solution Overview: Offline Policy Intel for Women Employees
ShePolicy Outline Navigator parses the PDF, tags headings into eight women‑focused buckets, builds a maternity‑leave timeline, and highlights clause deltas — all offline in < 5 seconds.

🔥 Core Features
Feature	1‑line Value
Category‑Aware Tagger	Auto‑labels headings: Maternity, Anti‑Harassment, Equal Pay…
Timeline Builder	Extracts “26 weeks” → renders leave → join‑back → WFH phases
Cross‑Version Diff	Drag two PDFs → see added / removed / modified clauses
Bucket Filter UI	Click Maternity chip → sidebar collapses to relevant 14 headings
Export JSON / PDF	One‑click shareable summary for manager / HR
💡 How It Works (Step‑by‑Step)
1️⃣ Front‑end drops PDF(s) into browser
2️⃣ pdf.js streams font‑metrics → heading list
3️⃣ Embedded DistilBERT‑tiny ONNX → assigns bucket label (offline)
4️⃣ Regex engine parses leave durations → JSON timeline
5️⃣ Optional second PDF runs diff → LCS flags clause changes
6️⃣ UI renders outline tree, chips, timeline card; export button writes JSON

🚀 Additional Goodies
✔️ Private‑Mode — no file upload, data never leaves laptop
✔️ Version History — keep cache of outlines, compare any two years
✔️ Mentor Directory — scans org‑chart PDFs, links Women‑in‑Tech ERG contacts
✔️ Reimbursement Wizard — autofill child‑care claim form from clause text

🛠 Tech Stack
Layer	Choice	Why
Front‑End	Pure HTML + CSS + JS	Zero build tools, runs from file://
PDF Parsing	pdf.js 3.11	Proven in‑browser extractor
ML Model	DistilBERT‑tiny (12 MB ONNX)	Fits CPU limit, 35 ms per heading
Cache	localStorage (outline)	Instant reload, no DB
Optional Back‑End	FastAPI helper (offline)	Faster on huge PDFs; exposes /outline, /diff, /thumbnail
Deployment: copy index.html + models/ to any laptop, or bundle as Tauri/Electron app (< 120 MB).

🔥 First reader that classifies HR PDFs specifically for women’s rights
🔥 Turns static policy into actionable timelines & clause diffs
🔥 Offline privacy meets strict enterprise compliance
🔥 HR workload drops; employees feel empowered → higher retention
